===========

A Remember The Milk client in Go. 

Yet another one-evening toy project,
the client implements the full auth flow,
and methods for adding and listing tasks.

You can easily extend existing code[1] to
use all other methods[2] just by copy-pasting
the existing ones.

Reference implementation is in "examples" directory,
./main.go contains a code intended for everyday usage by me.

Please also note the existence of "debugf" wrapper and "RTM_DEBUG"[3]
environment variable which are defined in the "rtm" package.
